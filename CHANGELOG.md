- embedded `hcl`

## [1.3.7] - 2020-01-07
### Fixed
- pinned `pyhcl` to `<0.3.14`
    - `0.3.14` vendored ply instead of having it as a dependency which breaks our embedded, patched copy

## [0.12.0] - 2018-04-02

    * Any previous `backend.tfvars` values should be moved into the primary (e.g. main.tf) backend config
