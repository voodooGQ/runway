Runway Config File
==================

Top-Level Configuration

Module
^^^^^^

.. autoclass:: runway.config.ModuleDefinition

Path
^^^^

.. automodule:: runway.path.Path

Git
---

Git remote resources can be used as modules for your Runway project. Below is
an example of git remote path.

Example:
    .. code-block:: yaml

        deployments:
            - modules:
                - git::git://github.com/foo/bar.git//my/path?branch=develop

The path is broken down into the following attributes:

``git``: The type of remote resource being retrieved, in this case **git**

``::``: Logical separator of the type from the rest of the path string

``git://github.com/foo/bar.git``: The protocol and URI address of the git
repository

``//`` **(optional)**: Logical separator of the URI from the remaining path
string

``my/path`` **(optional)**: The relative path from the root of the repo
where the module is housed

``?`` **(optional)**: Logical separator of the path from the options

``branch=develop`` **(optional)**:  The options to be passed. The Git module
accepts three different types of options: `commit`, `tag`, or `branch`. These
respectively point the repository at the reference id specified.

    # Order that tests will be run. Test execution is triggered with the
    # 'runway test' command. Testing will fail and exit if any of the
    # individual tests fail unless they are marked with 'required: false'.
    # Please see the doc section dedicated to tests for more details.

    tests:
      - name: test-names-are-optional
        type: script  # there are a few built in test types
        args:  # each test has their own set of arguments they can accept
          commands:

        required: false  # tests will still pass if this fails
      - type: yamllint  # not all tests accept arguments

    # Order that modules will be deployed. A module will be skipped if a
    # corresponding env/config is not present (either in a file in its folder
    # or via an environments option specified here on the deployment or
    # module)
    # E.g., for cfn modules, if
    # 1) a dev-us-west-2.env file is not in the 'app.cfn' folder when running
    #    a dev deployment of 'app' to us-west-2,
    # and
    # 2) dev is not specified under the deployment or module's environments
    #
    # then it will be skipped.
