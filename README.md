Runway is a lightweight integration app designed to ease management of infrastructure tools.

Its main goals are to encourage GitOps best-practices, avoid convoluted Makefiles/scripts (enabling identical deployments from a workstation or CI job), and enable developers/admins to use the best tool for any given job.


## Features

* Centralized environment-specific configuration
* Automatic environment identification from git branches
* Automatic linting/verification
* Support of IAM roles to assume for each deployment
* Terraform backend/workspace config management w/per-environment tfvars
* Automatic kubectl/terraform version management per-environment

### Supported Deployment Tools

* AWS CDK
* Kubectl
* Serverless Framework
* Stacker (CloudFormation)
* Static websites (build & deploy to S3+CloudFront)
* Terraform


## Example

A typical Runway configuration is unobtrusive -- it just lists the deployment order and locations (regions).

```yml
deployments:
  - modules:
    - resources.tf  # terraform resources
    - backend.sls  # serverless lambda functions
    - frontend  # static web site
    environments:  # Environment settings
        dev:
            foo: dev-bar
        prod:
            foo: prod-bar
```

The example above contains enough information for Runway to deploy all resources, lambda functions and a static website backed by S3 and Cloudfront in either dev or prod environments
